# Dog-Breed-Classifier

## Project Overview
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning in order to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used to analyse image data. Transfer learning is a technique that allows to reuse a model across different tasks. The objective is that given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. If the algorithm can't identify the image as a human or dog, it will say so.

## File descriptions
- dog_app.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the algorithm and process used to create it.
- dog_app.html: A copy of dog_app.ipynb in html format.
- Haarcascades folder: Xml file for use with the OpenCv face detector class.
- Various images: Images in jpg and jpeg format used to test the algorithm's predictions.

## Findings
The final model achieved a test accuracy of 81.4593%.
